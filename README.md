**Project Description: Predicting Cryptocurrency Price Changes**

**Overview:**
In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model to forecast price changes in cryptocurrencies. The dataset used for this project was obtained via the CoinMarketCap API, which provides comprehensive data about various cryptocurrencies, including market prices, trading volumes, and historical trends.

**Dataset:**
The dataset comprises a selection of features related to different cryptocurrencies, including their market performance metrics and other relevant information. Here are some key features included in the dataset:

- Quote currency volume change over 24 hours (`quote.USD.volume_change_24h`)
- Percentage change in price over 1 hour (`quote.USD.percent_change_1h`)
- Percentage change in price over 24 hours (`quote.USD.percent_change_24h`)
- Percentage change in price over 7 days (`quote.USD.percent_change_7d`)
- Percentage change in price over 30 days (`quote.USD.percent_change_30d`)
- Percentage change in price over 60 days (`quote.USD.percent_change_60d`)
- CoinMarketCap ranking (`cmc_rank`)
- Market capitalization in USD (`quote.USD.market_cap`)
- Market capitalization dominance (`quote.USD.market_cap_dominance`)

**Data Acquisition:**
The dataset was obtained by querying the CoinMarketCap API, which provides real-time and historical data on thousands of cryptocurrencies. The data was retrieved using Python scripts to interact with the API and store the results in a structured format suitable for analysis.

**Data Processing and Analysis:**
Upon acquiring the dataset, several preprocessing steps were performed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify correlations, and understand patterns in the data.

**Modeling Approach:**
Various regression algorithms were explored to develop predictive models for forecasting cryptocurrency price changes. Initially, simple models like Linear Regression were trained and evaluated. Subsequently, more sophisticated ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were employed to improve predictive accuracy.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using techniques like randomized search to optimize the performance of the chosen models. By systematically searching through different combinations of hyperparameters, the goal was to identify the settings that minimize prediction errors and improve model generalization.

**Model Evaluation and Validation:**
The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Cross-validation techniques were employed to estimate the models' generalization error and ensure robustness across different subsets of the data.

**Results:**
After rigorous experimentation and tuning, the tuned Gradient Boosting model emerged as the top performer, achieving a significantly lower MSE compared to other models. The final model was evaluated and validated to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in predicting cryptocurrency price changes.

**Next Steps:**
Moving forward, the finalized model will be deployed to production for making predictions on new cryptocurrency data. Continuous monitoring of the model's performance will be conducted, and further updates and improvements will be implemented as necessary to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
